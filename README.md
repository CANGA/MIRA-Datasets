CANGA Remapping Intercomparison Dataset Repository

This repository contains all the input meshes, sampled reference data on the meshes for 
several uniformly refined resolutions and regionally refined cases. These input meshes
were used to perform a remapping intercomparison study that analyzed the key numerical
metrics to gain better insight into the behavior of remapping algorithms, and to compare
several key properties under a unified framework.

Some of the metrics data collected for each of the cases include:

  - Error convergence data in global norms $L_1, L_2, L_{\inf}, H_1$ and $\left|H_1\right|$
  - Global bounds preservation
  - Local feature preservation
  - Mesh type and resolution invariance
